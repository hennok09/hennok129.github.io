  <h4>Progress Report</h4>
  <p>
	My current progress on my hardware project is on schedule with the Ganett Chart created back week 3. 
	Currently, I have been testing my PCB that have created last week and powering up the Rasberry Pi that I received last week. 
	I am planning to build the MeArm (Robotic arm) later this week if I can but the arm should be built by next week. 
	The budget that I made in week 4 is the same price as what I have spent last week on the products. 
	Current problems that I am having is whether or not my PCB board is functionally or not and I am hoping to have it ready by next week to test it on my Rasberry Pi. 
	Overall, my project is on schedule and will continue to work on time.

  My Order has arrived with Amazon Rasberry Pi and Hackalot MeArm. The total cost of these products reflect my budget
  correctly and I am ready to do an unboxing for both product.
  I've also completed my PCB board and will be testing it next tomorrow.

  For week two, I had submitted my hardware proposal of the MeArm - Pocket Sized Robot Arm. The arm is an open source robotic arm
  that can be controlled using JAVA, C and/or Python.
