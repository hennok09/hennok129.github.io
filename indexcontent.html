  <H4>Progress Report</H4>
  <p>
  After the Open House, I have received a few questions from the guests about my current progress on the project. Some of the questions
  that was asked were:
  <ul>
		<li>How does this work?</li>
		<li>What is powering the robot?</li>
		<li>Why does only one servo motor?</li>
		<li>When will it be complete</li>
  </ul>
  I am still working on the C code I used during the open house to move the motor using the keys on the keyboard. I am also looking into
  coding the program in a different programming language; specificity JAVA or Python. Another issue I am looking into is powering the other
  servo motors because my raspberry pi does not provide enough power to power-up the other motors. Currently, I am on schedule with the 
  ganett chart I made in week 3 and will continue with my project.

  <H4>Progress Report</H4>
  <p>
  Currently the project is going on schedule to most one of the servo motors for open
  house on November 12th, 2016. The servo motor will be powered by the raspberry pi's 
  5V power source and will also get a signal from the 12 pin of the pi. The program is coded in
  C and moves the arm left and right in a loop. My goal after this is to move the arm with the keys 
  on the keyboard.

  <h4>Progress Report</h4>
  <p>
	My current progress on my hardware project is on schedule with the Ganett Chart created back week 3. 
	Currently, I have been testing my PCB that have created last week and powering up the Rasberry Pi that I received last week. 
	I am planning to build the MeArm (Robotic arm) later this week if I can but the arm should be built by next week. 
	The budget that I made in week 4 is the same price as what I have spent last week on the products. 
	Current problems that I am having is whether or not my PCB board is functionally or not and I am hoping to have it ready by next week to test it on my Rasberry Pi. 
	Overall, my project is on schedule and will continue to work on time.

  <H3>Week 5</H3>
  <p>
  My Order has arrived with Amazon Rasberry Pi and Hackalot MeArm. The total cost of these products reflect my budget
  correctly and I am ready to do an unboxing for both product.
  I've also completed my PCB board and will be testing it next tomorrow.

 <SECTION ID="Section_4">
  <H3>Week 4</H3>
  <p>
  I ordered my Rasberry Pi and my Robot Arm and they are currently being shipped and is on the way.
  I started working on soldering my PCB and will complete it by next week.

 <SECTION ID="Section_3">
  <H3>Week 3</H3>
  <p>
  I have completed My Project Schedule using Microsoft Project. I have also continued to practice soldering, started working on my budget, 
  and looking at options with stores such as Canada Computer, Amazon, and Best Buy.

  <p>
  For week two, I had submitted my hardware proposal of the MeArm - Pocket Sized Robot Arm. The arm is an open source robotic arm
  that can be controlled using JAVA, C and/or Python.
