  The F.I.M.P. project is a robotic arm controlled by 4 servo motors powered by a 5V power supply and operated by a raspberry pi 3. The purpose of the project is
  to have construction operations to be done in a safer environment(example would be to have crane machines operated from a safer distance than have it be directly controlled
  by humans). The goal is to move all motors with a sensor (such as light sensor) and have the arm move with a mobile app as well.
