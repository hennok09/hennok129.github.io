  The F.I.M.P. project is a robotic arm controlled by 4 servo motors powered by a 5V power supply and operated by a raspberry pi 3. The purpose of the project is
  to have construction operations to be done in a safer environment(example would be to have crane machines operated from a safer distance than have it be directly controlled
  by humans). The goal is to move all motors with a sensor (such as light sensor) and have the arm move with a mobile app as well.

	  My oringinal Budget was to purchase a Raspberry Pi 3 along with the Mearm kit but over the course of the 14 weeks 
	  I purchased 2 servo motors for testing the movement of the servo motor and a 5V power supply module for powering the 4 
	  servo motors due to the raspberry pi not having enough power to move all 4 motors. This is my overall budget:

	  Following the gannett chart created in week 3, I have bought, assembled and created the code for the project. This table
	  will go over the time I have spent when working on this project:
	  <table>
		  <tr>
		    <th>Task</th>
		    <th>Time Spent</th>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Purchased The Raspberry Pi 3 and Me Arm kit</td>
		    <td align="right">5 days(Shipping)</td>
		  </tr>
		  <tr>
		    <td>Assembly of the MeArm and Raspberry Pi setup</td>
		    <td align="right">2 Hours</td>

	  In total, I spent about 17 hours working on the project and spent 5 day waiting for 
	  my parts to arrive.
