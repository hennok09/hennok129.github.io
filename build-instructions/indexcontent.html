  The F.I.M.P. project is a robotic arm controlled by 4 servo motors powered by a 5V power supply and operated by a raspberry pi 3. The purpose of the project is
  to have construction operations to be done in a safer environment(example would be to have crane machines operated from a safer distance than have it be directly controlled
  by humans). The goal is to move all motors with a sensor (such as light sensor) and have the arm move with a mobile app as well.

  <p>
	  My oringinal Budget was to purchase a Raspberry Pi 3 along with the Mearm kit but over the course of the 14 weeks 
	  I purchased 2 servo motors for testing the movement of the servo motor and a 5V power supply module for powering the 4 
	  servo motors due to the raspberry pi not having enough power to move all 4 motors. This is my overall budget:

	  Following the gannett chart created in week 3, I have bought, assembled and created the code for the project. This table
	  will go over the time I have spent when working on this project:

	  In total, I spent about 17 hours working on the project and spent 5 day waiting for 
	  my parts to arrive.

  <p>The PCB is used to move the robotic arm with the light sensor when specific light readings are taken. When a light mesurement is
     in a regular room light measurement, the robotic arm will stay centered. When the room is dark, the arm will move to the left and
     when the room is too bright, the arm moves to the right.</p>

  <p>This is code that I used to control the servo motors with user inputs:</p>
  <code>
#include <iostream>
#include <wiringPi.h>
#include <unistd.h>
using namespace std;

#define PWM_SERVO     18      // this is PWM0, pin 12
#define BUTTON_GPIO   27      // this is GPIO27, pin 13
#define LEFT          29      // manually calibrated values
#define RIGHT         118     // for the left, right and
#define CENTER        73      // center servo positions
bool sweeping = true;         // sweep servo until button pressed

void buttonPress(void) {      // ISR on button press - not debounced
   cout << "Button was pressed -- finishing sweep." << endl;
   sweeping = false;          // the while() loop should end soon
}

int main() {                             // must be run as root
   wiringPiSetupGpio();                  // use the GPIO numbering
   pinMode(PWM_SERVO, PWM_OUTPUT);       // the PWM servo
   pinMode(BUTTON_GPIO, INPUT);          // the button input
   wiringPiISR(BUTTON_GPIO, INT_EDGE_RISING, &buttonPress);
   pwmSetMode(PWM_MODE_MS);              // use a fixed frequency
   pwmSetRange(1000);                    // 1000 steps
   pwmSetClock(384);                     // gives 50Hz precisely

   cout << "Sweeping the servo until the button is pressed" << endl;
   while(sweeping) {
      for(int i=LEFT; i<RIGHT; i++) {       // Fade fully on
         pwmWrite(PWM_SERVO, i);
         usleep(10000);
      }
      for(int i=RIGHT; i>=LEFT; i--) {        // Fade fully off
         pwmWrite(PWM_SERVO, i);
         usleep(10000);
      }
   }
   pwmWrite(PWM_SERVO, CENTER);
   cout << "Program has finished gracefully - servo centred" << endl;
   return 0;
}
